# OdoQueue

**OdoQueue** is a lightweight task and note management app designed for developers who think in queues, workflows, and logs.

Instead of juggling scattered todos and notes, OdoQueue helps you put work in order — one task at a time.

## 🚀 What is OdoQueue?

OdoQueue is built around a simple idea:

> **Work is a queue. Clear it step by step.**

Each task lives in a queue and can have notes, context, and logs attached to it.  
No clutter. No over-engineering. Just focused execution.
